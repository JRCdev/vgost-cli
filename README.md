# vgost-cli
A python-based command line interface to download video game OSTs

---
### Purpose

A tool written to scrape the khinsider repository of video game soundtracks

### Installation guide

Currently, since it's just the one script, just clone the repo and run it via python:

```
python vgost-cli.py [write-location]
```

### Future developments

 * Making it so that the script can be installed and invoked as a command
 * Extend usability with flags
   * Play music instead of downloading?
   * Give choice to download one song instead of album?
